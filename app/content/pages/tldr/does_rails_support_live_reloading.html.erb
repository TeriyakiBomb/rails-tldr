title: Does Rails support Live reload in development?
---

<%= component "TldrContainer", current_page: current_page do |component| %>

  <% component.with_tldr do %>
    Yes! - Theres a bunch of ways to do this, all of them pretty simple.
  <% end %>

<%= component "Article::Markdown" do %>

   If you've come from a lot of other frameworks, you might be used to hot/live reload in your browser during development. Rails does this too! Let's go through some of the options:
   <% end %>

   <%= component "Badge" %>
   Note: for all of these (And in general) be sure to run `bin/dev` from your rails root directory instead of `rails/server`, if you'd like to know why, click here.

<%= component "Article::Markdown" do %>



   ## Hotwire spark
   This is the (At time of writing) newly released first party live reload solution for Rails. It is not included by default at this time, but installation and confguration is a breeze. Spark is still fairly new and there's a few teething options

   ## Hotwire livereload
   https://github.com/kirillplatonov/hotwire-livereload
   This gem is just as easy to use, a single line in your gemfile and you're basically done.

   ## Rails live reload
   https://github.com/railsjazz/rails_live_reload
   This takes just one more command than the other two to get working.
