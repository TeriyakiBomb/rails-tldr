# Contribution and writing style

tl;dr's are a series of short articles aiming to answer the most commonly asked questions about rails and disambiguate confusing ideas. 

tl;dr's should:

- Be friendly in tone, positive but factual and fair about Rails and both its benefits and shortcomings.
- Be concise.
- Represent the current state of Rails, ie - focus on features available in recent versions only.
- Written to be read by non-rubyists
- Be written simply. We can assume a reader has _some_ development experience, but not explicitly for novice developers.

Should not:
- Be dogmatic. Present options, the end goal is clarity after all. The "Rails way" is good, as are sensible defaults, but people all have different needs.
- Disparage other frameworks, technologies or approaches.
- Disparage or focus on any one individual. We're a community after all, and we should be nice.*
- Be obscure or over tutorialize. We can't cover everything and fewer, better quality articles is better. Further reading sections should be used for tutorials.
